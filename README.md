### Why this project :
I'm learning web development because that interest me. Now this project is created by learning from Clever Programmer (https://www.youtube.com/c/CleverProgrammer/featured) thanks to them for sharing free class on google. 
I choose this project because i want practice Chart.js and Leaflet with a project for be able to display dynamic chart and data on a webpage and also map. 

### What i learn and practice from this project :
  - BEM naming convention and i find this convention really great for when we want to make a new style of a component, we can easily see which modifiers and children already exist. Finally this convention make the process for writting css/html more clean and easier to understand. 
  - Practicing React/javascript/hmtl/css 

### Some reflexion about the project and realtime database :
I think that using redux (store/reducer) will reduce the complexity of the project because the data will be easily available for each component. Otherwise, I already used chart.js without wrapper in another project and I find it more convenient to use it without because it's more flexible. Anyway, I find this project really good to practice react and props because a lot of components communicate with each other using props to share data.

In all cases, I'm now thinking about practicing web development from the courses of the online platform freecodecamps : https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/ and their different certifications based on concrete projects. I think it could strengthen my bases, and widen my field of vision on this domain and a better understanding. Maybe also Odin project : https://www.theodinproject.com/paths. 

Originally after practicing react I thought I wanted to go deeper. Therefore go on next.js, react-native, electron but finally I think it's better to go on trainings that will give me a more global vision. I think that it will allow me to learn and adapt faster to the evolution in this environment.
